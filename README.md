# Wikipedia-summary-fa-en
I wrote all this code instead of a simple python.wikipedia.summary
for 3 reasons:<br />
1. wikipedia module needs exact inputs and cant guess based on any name
try "rafsenjani" or "ahmadi nejad"<br />
2. wikipedia module may get confused about some names idk why
try "ali daei", even tho its an exact id of a page, we get an error<br />
3. i feel its a bit slow<br />
Required libraries:<br />
```
pip install requests
```
```
pip install easygui
```
```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```
```
pip install tk
```
```
pip install langdetect
```
